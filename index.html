                No real surprises on who tops the list of popular car brands in India. The Indian manufacturer offers a balanced package for middle-class families with vehicles ranging from small-city hatchbacks to premium SUVs. They provide best-in-class cabin space, mileage, service, and affordable pricing thus enabling them to dominate the Indian market. However, there are compromises on some factors such as safety and build quality on some of their entry-level products. They predominantly offer city hatchbacks and sedans with cars such as the Alto, Wagon R, Baleno, Swift, Dzire, S-Presso, Alto, Ignis, Ciaz, and much more.

                Tata is one of the popular car brands in India that has had its fair share of ups and downs. Tata Motors is a leading automotive manufacturer across passenger cars, trucks, buses, vans, and other segments. Since its acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover in 2008, its fortunes changed as its sales doubled, new factories opened and it gave jobs to thousands of employees. With the launch of its popular Nexon compact SUV, the shift in focus to better-build quality and safety helped it become a solid choice for Indian consumers and enabled it to make a solid comeback. Their product range includes quality hatchbacks, sedans, and SUVs such as the Nexon, Punch, Harrier, Safari, Altroz, Tiago, and Tigor. Tata also leads the EV segment, with the Nexon EV and Tigor EV, and the upcoming Tiago EV which is also the cheapest EV to be sold in India. It was recently unveiled by the Indian carmaker and is now expected to hit showrooms by mid-January.
